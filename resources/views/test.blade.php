Research email verification techniques: There are various techniques you can use to verify an email address, such as syntax validation, domain verification, MX record validation, SMTP handshake, and mailbox existence checking. You need to understand these techniques and determine which ones to use in your tool.

Develop an email verification algorithm: Once you understand the verification techniques, you need to develop an algorithm that combines these techniques to verify an email address. The algorithm should handle edge cases and return accurate results.

Implement the email verification algorithm in code: You can use any programming language to implement your email verification algorithm. PHP, Python, Java, and Ruby are popular choices for developing email verification tools.

Set up email servers and protocols: To verify email addresses, you need to interact with email servers and protocols, such as SMTP, POP3, and IMAP. You need to set up email servers and protocols to test your email verification tool.

Develop a user interface: Once you have implemented the email verification algorithm, you need to develop a user interface for your tool. The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use, with options to upload a list of email addresses to verify and view the verification results.

Test and refine the tool: You need to test your email verification tool thoroughly and refine it based on user feedback and testing results. You may need to adjust the verification algorithm or improve the user interface to make the tool more effective and user-friendly.

Developing an email verification tool like ZeroBounce.net is a complex task that requires significant expertise and resources. If you don't have the expertise or resources to develop your own tool, you can consider using an existing email verification service like ZeroBounce.net or other similar services available in the market.
